Name: MODIS/Terra Geolocation Fields 5-Min L1A Swath 1km
Description: "The MODIS/Terra Geolocation Fields 5Min L1A Swath 1km are calculated
  for each 1 km MODIS Instantaneous Field of Views (IFOV) for all orbits daily (in
  Collection 6 and later, information is provided to claculate 500m geolocation fields).
  \ The locations and ancillary information corresponds to the intersection of the
  centers of each IFOV from 10 detectors in an ideal 1 km band on the Earth's surface.
  A digital terrain model is used to model the Earth's surface. The main inputs are
  the spacecraft attitude and orbit, the instrument telemetry and the digital elevation
  model. The geolocation fields include geodetic Latitude, Longitude, surface height
  above geoid, solar zenith and azimuth angles, satellite zenith and azimuth angles,
  and a land/sea mask for each 1 km sample. Additional information is included in
  the header to enable the calculation of the approximate location of the center of
  the detectors of any of the 36 MODIS bands. This product is used as input by a large
  number of subsequent MODIS products, particularly the products produced by the Land
  team.\r\n\r\nThe short name for this product is MOD03. Each file is roughly 30 MB
  in size, and the total data volume is approximately 8 GB/day.\r\n\r\nSee the MODIS
