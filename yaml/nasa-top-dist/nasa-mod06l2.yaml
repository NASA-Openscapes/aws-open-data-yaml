Name: MODIS/Terra Clouds 5-Min L2 Swath 1km and 5km
Description: "The MODIS/Terra Clouds 5-Min L2 Swath 1km and 5km product (MOD06_L2)
  consists of cloud optical and physical parameters. These parameters are derived
  using remotely sensed infrared, visible and near infrared solar reflected radiances.
  MODIS infrared channel radiances are used to derive cloud top temperature, cloud
  top height, effective emissivity, cloud phase (ice vs. water, opaque vs. non-opaque),
  and cloud fraction under both daytime and nighttime conditions. MODIS visible radiances
  are used to derive cloud optical thickness and effective particle radius and cloud
  shadow effects. Near infrared solar reflected radiance provides additional information
  in the retrieval of cloud particle phase (ice vs. water, clouds vs. snow). The shortname
  for this level-2 MODIS cloud product is MOD06_L2. MOD06_L2 consists of parameters
  at a spatial resolution of either 1- km or 5-km (at nadir). Each MOD06_L2 product
  file covers a five-minute time interval. This means that for 5-km resolution parameters,
  the output grid is 270 pixels in width by 406 pixels in length.\r\n\r\nC6.1 changes
  for the cloud optical property retrievals are low-impact, and are limited primarily
  to ancillary product usage, the Quality Assurance (QA), and handling of cloud top
  (CT) properties fill values; no updates to retrieval science are implemented.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe
  MODIS Cloud Product is used to investigate seasonal and inter-annual changes in
  cirrus (semi-transparent) global cloud cover and cloud phase with multispectral
  observations at high spatial (1 kilometer) resolution.\r\n\r\nFor more information
