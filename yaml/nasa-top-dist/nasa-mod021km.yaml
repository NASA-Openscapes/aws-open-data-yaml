Name: MODIS/Terra Calibrated Radiances 5-Min L1B Swath 1km
Description: "The MODIS/Terra Calibrated Radiances 5Min L1B Swath 1km data set contains
  calibrated and geolocated at-aperture radiances for 36 discrete bands located in
  the 0.4 to 14.4 micron region of the electromagnetic spectrum. These data are generated
  from the MODIS Level 1A scans of raw radiance which during processing are converted
  to geophysical units of W/(m^2 um sr). Additional data are provided including quality
  flags, error estimates and calibration data.\r\n\r\nVisible, shortwave infrared,
  and near infrared measurements are only made during the daytime (except band 26),
  while radiances for the thermal infrared region (bands 20-25, 27-36) are measured
  continuously.\r\n\r\nThe shortname for this product is MOD021KM and is stored in
  the Earth Observing System Hierarchical Data Format (HDF-EOS). A typical file size
  is approximately 110 MB (a day granule around 150MB and a night granule around 70
  MB).\r\n\r\nIn this new version (Collection 6.1) of MOD021KM, an advanced technique
  is introduced to mitigate the crosstalk contamination issue among the LWIR PV bands
  \ \r\nusing data from lunar calibration events. \r\n\r\nThe electronic crosstalk
  contamination issue in the Terra long-wave infrared photovoltaic (LWIR PV) bands
  (27 -30), has existed since the beginning of the mission but become more noticeable
  during later half of the mission. The electronic crosstalk is where signal from
  each of the detectors among the LWIR PV bands can leak to the other detectors, producing
  a false signal contribution. This contamination has had a noticeable effect on the
  MODIS science products since 2010 for band 27, and since 2012 for bands 28 and 29.\r\n\r\nEnvironmental
  information derived from MODIS L1B measurements will offer a comprehensive and unprecedented
  look at terrestrial, atmospheric, and ocean phenomenology for a wide and diverse
  community of users throughout the world.\r\n\r\nSee the MODIS Characterization Support
