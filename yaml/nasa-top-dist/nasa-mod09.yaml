Name: MODIS/Terra Atmospherically Corrected Surface Reflectance 5-Min L2 Swath 250m,
  500m, 1km
Description: |-
  The MODIS/Terra Atmospherically Corrected Surface Reflectance 5-Min L2 Swath 250m, 500m, 1km (MOD09) product is computed from the MODIS Level 1B land bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 (centered at 648 nm, 858 nm, 470 nm, 555 nm, 1240 nm, 1640 nm, and 2130 nm, respectively). The product is an estimate of the surface spectral reflectance for each band as it would have been measured at ground level if there were no atmospheric scattering or absorption. The surface-reflectance product is the input for product generation for several land products: vegetation Indices (VIs), Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF), thermal anomaly, snow/ice, and Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation/Leaf Area Index (FPAR/LAI).
