Name: MODIS/Aqua Calibrated Radiances 5-Min L1B Swath 250m
Description: "The MODIS/Terra Calibrated Radiances 5-Min L1B Swath 250m data set contains
  calibrated and geolocated at-aperture radiances for 2 discrete bands located in
  the 0.62 to 0.88 micron region of the electromagnetic spectrum. These data are generated
  from the MODIS Level 1A scans of raw radiance which during processing are converted
  to geophysical units of W / (m^2 um sr). Additional data are provided including
  quality flags, error estimates and calibration data. \r\n\r\nSeparate L1B products
  are available for the five 500m resolution channels (MYD02HKM) and the twenty-nine
  1km resolution channels (MYD021KM). For the 500m product, there are actually seven
  channels available since the data from the two 250 m channels have been aggregated
  to 500m resolution.  Similarly, for the 1km product, all 36 MODIS channels are available
  since the data from the two 250m and five 500m channels have been aggregated into
  equivalent 1km\r\npixel values.\r\n\r\nSpatial resolution for pixels at nadir is
  250 m, degrading to 1.2 km in the along-scan direction and 0.5 km in the along-track
  direction for pixels located at the scan extremes. A 55 degree scanning pattern
  at the EOS orbit of 705 km results in a 2330 km orbital swath width and provides
  global coverage every one to two days. A single MODIS Level 1B 250 m granule will
  contain a scene built from 203 scans sampled 5416 times in the cross-track direction,
  corresponding to approximately 5 minutes worth of data; thus 288 granules will be
  produced per day. Since an individual MODIS scan will contain 40 along-track spatial
  elements for the 250 m channels, the scene will be composed of (5416 x 8120) pixels,
  resulting in a spatial coverage of (2330 km x 2040 km). Due to the MODIS scan geometry,
  there will be increasing scan overlap beyond about 17 degrees scan angle.\r\n\r\nThe
  shortname for this product is MYD02QKM and is stored in the Earth Observing System
  Hierarchical\r\nData Format (HDF-EOS). A typical file size will be approximately
  140 MB and the total daily volume is around 22GB.\r\n\r\nEnvironmental information
  derived from MODIS L1B measurements will offer a comprehensive and unprecedented
  look at terrestrial, atmospheric, and ocean phenomenology for a wide and diverse
  community of users throughout the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nSee the MODIS Characterization
