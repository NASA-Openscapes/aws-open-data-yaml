Name: MODIS/Aqua Calibrated Radiances 5-Min L1B Swath 1km
Description: "The MODIS/Aqua Calibrated Radiances 5Min L1B Swath 1km data set contains
  calibrated and geolocated at-aperture radiances for 36 discrete bands located in
  the 0.4 to 14.4 micron region of the electromagnetic spectrum. These data are generated
  from the MODIS Level 1A scans of raw radiance which during processing are converted
  to geophysical units of W / (m^2 um sr). Additional data are provided including
  quality flags, error estimates and calibration data.\r\n\r\nVisible, shortwave infrared,
  and near infrared measurements are only made during the daytime (except band 26),
  while radiances for the thermal infrared region (bands 20-25, 27-36) are measured
  continuously.\r\n\r\nThe shortname for this product is MYD021KM and is stored in
  the Earth Observing System Hierarchical Data Format (HDF-EOS). A typical file size
  is approximately 115 MB.\r\n\r\nEnvironmental information derived from MODIS L1B
  measurements will offer a comprehensive and unprecedented look at terrestrial, atmospheric,
  and ocean phenomenology for a wide and diverse community of users throughout the
  world.\r\n\r\nSee the MODIS Characterization Support Team webpage for more C6 product
