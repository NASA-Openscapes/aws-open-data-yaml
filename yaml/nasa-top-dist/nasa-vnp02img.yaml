Name: VIIRS/NPP Imagery Resolution 6-Min L1B Swath 375 m
Description: |-
  The VIIRS/NPP Imagery Resolution 6-Min L1B Swath 375 m product, short-name VNP02IMG is derived from the five image-resolution or I-bands, which have a 375-meter resolution at nadir. Ranging in wavelengths from 0.6 µm to 12.4 µm, the I-bands are sensitive to visible/reflective, near-, shortwave-, mediumwave-, and longwave-infrared wavelengths.  Derived from the NASA VIIRS L1A raw radiances, this product includes calibrated and geolocated radiance and reflectance data, quality flags, and granule- and collection-level metadata.  In contrast to a MODIS L1B product, which temporally spans 5 minutes, the VIIRS L1B calibrated radiances product contains a nominal temporal duration of 6 minutes.  The image dimensions of the 375-m swath product measure 6464 lines by 6400 pixels.
