Name: S-MODE L2 Position Data from Surface Drifters Version 1
Description: "This dataset contains in-situ position data from surface drifters from
  the Sub-Mesoscale Ocean Dynamics Experiment (S-MODE) conducted approximately 300
  km offshore of San Francisco during a pilot campaign over two weeks in October 2021,
  and two intensive operating periods (IOPs) in Fall 2022 and Spring 2023. S-MODE
  aims to understand how ocean dynamics acting on short spatial scales influence the
  vertical exchange of physical and biological variables in the ocean. Drifting buoys
  were deployed from the research vessels and configured to nominally report positions
  every five minutes. Drifters deployed were a mixture of CARTHE and Microstar types.
  CARTHE drifters are drogued at 40 cm depth and measure the average horizontal velocity
  of currents in the upper 60 cm of the ocean (Novelli et al., 2017). Microstar drifters
  are drogued at 1 m depth and measure the average horizontal velocity of ocean currents
  between 0.4 m and 1.6 m depth (Ohlmann et al., 2005). See the S-MODE Data Submission
  Report sections 2.3.2.2, 2.4.2.2 and 2.5.2.3 for more information. Tracking and
  telemetry of the drifters is done by Pacific Gyre, Inc. The data are available in
  netCDF format with a dimension of time. \n<br><br>\n Novelli, G., C. M. Guigand,
