Name: SWOT Level 2 River Single-Pass Vector Data Product, Version D
Description: |-
  The SWOT Level 2 River Single-Pass Vector Data Product (SWOT_L2_HR_RiverSP_D) provides hydrologic measurements for predefined river reaches and nodes, derived from high-resolution radar observations collected by the Ka-band Radar Interferometer (KaRIn) aboard the SWOT satellite. This product reports water surface elevation, slope, width, area, and discharge estimates for each reach, along with corresponding node-level details. All features are defined by the Prior River Database (PRD), which encodes river geometry and topology across global basins.
  <br><br>
  Each granule covers a single satellite pass over one or more continents and includes two ESRI shapefiles: one for river reaches (as polylines) and one for nodes (as points). Shapefile attributes include both SWOT-derived measurements and metadata from the PRD. Water surface elevations are referenced to the WGS84 ellipsoid and are corrected for geoid height and solid Earth, load, and pole tides. Measurements are aggregated from lower-level pixel detections (PIXC product) assigned to hydrologic features via the auxiliary PIXCVec product. The product also includes consensus and algorithm-specific river discharge estimates, both unconstrained and constrained by historical gauge data.
  <br><br>
  The RiverSP product provides reach-scale hydrologic variables suitable for analyzing inland water dynamics, estimating discharge, and monitoring river changes over time. It enables direct integration with the PRD-defined river network and supports applications in large-scale hydrologic modeling, basin monitoring, and water resource management. Data are distributed in shapefile format with metadata and attribute definitions aligned to GIS and hydrologic standards.<br>
