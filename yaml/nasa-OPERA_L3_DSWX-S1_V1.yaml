Name: OPERA Dynamic Surface Water Extent from Sentinel-1 (Version 1)
Description: "This dataset contains Level-3 Dynamic OPERA Surface Water Extent from
  Sentinel-1 (DSWx-S1) product version 1.  DSWx-S1 provides near-global geographical
  mapping of surface water extent over land at a spatial resolution of 30 meters over
  the Military Grid reference System (MGRS) grid system, with a temporal revisit frequency
  between 6-12 days. Using Sentinel-1 radar observations, DSWx-S1 maps open inland
  water bodies greater than 3 hectares and 200 meters in width, irrespective of cloud
  conditions and daylight illumination that often pose challenges to optical sensors.
  Forward production of the DSWx-S1 data record began in Sept 2024.  Each product
  is distributed as a set of 3 GeoTIFF (Geographic Tagged Image File Format) files
  including water classification and associated confidence layers.\n<br><br>\nThe
  OPERA DSWx-S1 product contains modified Copernicus Sentinel data (2024-2025).\n<br><br>\nTo
  access the calibration/validation database for OPERA Dynamic Surface Water Extent
