Name: S-MODE Shipboard Radiometer Measurements Version 1
Description: "This dataset contains shipboard radiometer measurements taken during
  the Sub-Mesoscale Ocean Dynamics Experiment (S-MODE) pilot campaign conducted approximately
  300 km offshore of San Francisco over two weeks in October 2021. S-MODE aims to
  understand how ocean dynamics acting on short spatial scales influence the vertical
  exchange of physical and biological variables in the ocean. Air-Sea Interaction
  METeorology (ASIMET) sensors mounted onboard the R/V Oceanus record shortwave and
  longwave radiation fluxes. These are used by S-MODE to compare with DopplerScatt
  retrievals. Data are available in netCDF format. \nRead our doc on how to get AWS
